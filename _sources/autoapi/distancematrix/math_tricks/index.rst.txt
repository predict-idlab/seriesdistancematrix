.. function:: sliding_mean_std(series, m)

   Calculates the sliding mean and standard deviation over the series using a window of size m.
   The series should only contain finite values.

   :param series: 1D numpy array
   :param m: sliding window size
   :return: tuple of 2 arrays, each of size (len(series) - m + 1)


.. function:: sliding_mean_var(series, m)

   Calculates the sliding mean and variance over the series using a window of size m.
   The series should only contain finite values.

   :param series: 1D numpy array
   :param m: sliding window size
   :return: tuple of 2 arrays, each of size (len(series) - m + 1)


.. py:class:: StreamingStats(series, m)

   Bases: :class:`object`

   Class that tracks a data stream and corresponding mean and standard deviation of a window over this data.

   The data stream has to be updated by the user, after which the mean/std stream will be updated automatically.

   This class uses RingBuffers internally, so any old view (data, mean, std) should be considered unreliable
   after new data was pushed to this class.
