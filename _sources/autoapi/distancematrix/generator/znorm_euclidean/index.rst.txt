.. py:class:: ZNormEuclidean(noise_std=0.0, rb_scale_factor=2.0)

   Bases: :class:`distancematrix.generator.abstract_generator.AbstractGenerator`

   Class capable of efficiently calculating parts of the z-normalized distance matrix between two series,
   where each entry in the distance matrix equals the euclidean distance between 2 z-normalized
   (zero mean and unit variance) subsequences of both series.

   This generator can handle streaming data.

   Subsequences with standard deviation <= 1e-6 will be treated as flat sequences to avoid problems
   with numerical stability.

   .. method:: prepare_streaming(self, m, series_window, query_window=None)

      Create a bound generator that supports streaming data.
      The generator will need to receive data before any distances can be calculated.

      :param m: the size of the subsequences used to calculate distances between series and query
      :param series_window: number of values to keep in memory for series, the length of the
        horizontal axis of the distance matrix will be equal to (series_window - m + 1)
      :param query_window: number of values to keep in memory for query, the length of the
        vertical axis of the distance matrix will be equal to (query_window - m + 1),
        or None to indicate a self-join.
      :return: a bound generator that supports streaming


   .. method:: prepare(self, m, series, query=None)

      Create a bound non-streaming generator for the given series and query sequences.

      :param m: the size of the subsequences used to calculate distances between series and query
      :param series: 1D array, used as the horizontal axis of a distance matrix
      :param query: 1D array, used as the vertical axis of a distance matrix, or None to indicate a self-join
      :return: a bound generator



.. py:class:: BoundZNormEuclidean(m, series, query, self_join, noise_std, series_mu, series_std, series_std_nz, query_mu, query_std, query_std_nz)

   Bases: :class:`distancematrix.generator.abstract_generator.AbstractBoundStreamingGenerator`

   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.

   .. method:: append_series(self, values)

      Adds more data points to the series sequence (and the query in case of a self-join).
      Older data points will be dropped if the series would become larger than the foreseen capacity.

      :param values: 1D array, the new values to append to the series
      :return: None


   .. method:: append_query(self, values)

      Adds more data points to the query sequence.
      Older data points will be dropped if the query would become larger than the foreseen capacity.

      :param values: 1D array, the new values to append to the query
      :return: None


   .. method:: calc_diagonal(self, diag)


   .. method:: calc_column(self, column)


   .. method:: calc_single(self, row, column, dot_prod=None)

      Calculates a single point of the distance matrix.

      :param row: index of the subsequence in the query series
      :param column: index of the subsequence in the data series
      :param dot_prod: the dotproduct of the subsequences, if provided, this method can run in constant time
      :return: z-normalised distance of the 2 subsequences
